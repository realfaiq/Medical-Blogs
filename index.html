            <img src="img/1.PNG" alt="Blog-1">
            <p>COVID-19 cases are dropping across the nation, but for many people, there’s still a high risk of getting infected. If you’re diagnosed with COVID-19 and you’re at high risk for developing a severe case, you could qualify for monoclonal antibody treatment (mAb).

                Monoclonal antibody treatment has been authorized for emergency use by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to treat mild to moderate COVID-19. “This treatment can help your body clear the COVID-19 virus more quickly and may reduce your symptoms,” said Emily Richards, a medication use specialist with Banner Pharmacy Services in Phoenix. “The monoclonal antibody binds to the COVID-19 virus and may prevent it from attacking more human cells and from spreading in your body.”
                
                In clinical trials, only 2% of people who received monoclonal antibody therapy developed severe symptoms or needed to be hospitalized... <a href="ReadMore-1.html" class="RM">Read-More</a></p>

            <img src="img/2.PNG" alt="Blog-2">
            <p>Imagine constantly hearing a ringing in one ear, both ears or even in your head. It might last for a few seconds or it might go on for minutes. You wish it would stop, but it won’t. It’s so maddening that it interferes with every aspect of your life. What was just described is called tinnitus and for more than 45 million Americans, it’s a daily struggle to live with it.

                There have been numerous reports of hearing-related issues popping up as a result of COVID-19. Tinnitus was one of those conditions. But can we make the connection based on what we know so far? Sarah Sydlowski, AuD, PhD, MBA, helps us gain a better understanding of what tinnitus is and the available treatment options... <a href="ReadMore-2.html" class="RM">Read-More</a></p>

            <p>It’s bedtime, and not a creature is stirring…except for your racing mind, that is. Why is it that even after a relatively anxiety-free day, our minds sometimes go into overdrive when our heads hit the pillow?

            <p>It’s 3 a.m. and you’re wide awake. It’s not because you had too much coffee or need to use the bathroom. You’re up because a panic attack jolted you out of your sleep. You’re sweating, breathing hard, your heart is racing and you can’t shake the panic or dread you’re feeling in that moment.

                Why did this happen and is there any way to prevent this going forward? Clinical psychologist Scott Bea, PsyD, explains why nighttime panic attacks... <a href="ReadMore-4.html" class="RM">Read-More</a></p>

            <p>With the coronavirus pandemic receding and many people vaccinated, all the single ladies (and others!) may be ready to fire up those dating apps or head out to their favorite club for some actual in-person connection. 

                But there’s an eerie trend that’s on the rise, and it doesn’t just affect your love life. Ghosting, as the spooky moniker suggests, is the act of abruptly disconnecting from all forms of tech contact and disappearing from a potential partner’s life without any explanation. And it’s the new norm in romance — and beyond. According to a 2018 study, 25% of participants said they’d experienced being ghosted by a romantic partner... <a href="ReadMore-5.html" class="RM">Read-More</a></p>

            <p>Warm, sunny days are perfect for outdoor exercise. You don’t need a jacket or gloves. You don’t have to worry about slipping on a patch of ice during your morning jog. Just throw on your shoes and go, right?

                Careful — sunny days have risks, too. If your body gets too hot, you could get heat illness. In mild cases, you might feel miserable for a few hours. But serious cases can be life-threatening.
